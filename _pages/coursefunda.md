The ways to crack are few. The ways to flunk are many. Ahh.. the life's miseries!

===== How to crack this course? =====

  * Attend all the classes
  * Solve all asignments regularly
  * Practice yourself the derivations done in the class
  * Be attentive to the problem description, units and the assumptions

===== How to flunk this course? =====

  * Bunk as many classes as you feel like, preferably in a row.
  * Don't pick up the notes from web or waste money purchasing any of the referred books.
  * Don't waste time solving assignments, just copy from a friend or better still, don't bother submitting them.
  * Don't bother about derivations or assumptions and cog the final formula.
  * Take up so many of sports or cultural activities at the institute that you dont have time for anything academic.
  * Get so paranoid about GRE that you read english novels all the time, even during classes. It could surely help.
  * Get panic about CAT and take up tutions outside the campus. Spend most of the time on campus preparing for that.
  * Play video games everyday so that you lose interest in acads.
  * Read business magazines till late everyday, sleep late, wake up late and miss breakfast. That should do enough damage to your health and mind to take care of the rest.
  * Get caught doing malpractice during exam.

===== The paradox of the disinterested =====

There are guys who hate academics at IIT so much that they withdraw from the system to the extent of flunking. The paradox is that once a student cups in more than two courses, he/she will need an extra year to finish the degree. That means the student has to stay longer at the institute. You dont like, you stay longer. You like, you finish off in time. Hmm...
