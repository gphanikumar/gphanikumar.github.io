# Thermal field and stress analysis using Simufact &trade; suite

We have used the Simufact suite of tools to study thermal field and stress analysis of materials in different processes. Simufact-Forming allowed for deformation studies. Simufact-additive provides stress evolution during 3D printing of metallic parts. Simufact-Welding allows for simulation of welding process to optimize the process conditions before performing actual welding.
