# Links to Online resources on Thermodynamics of Materials

## Books
  * [Thermodynamics of Materials](https://www.worldcat.org/profiles/gphanikumar/lists/3985955) - list of books on [WorldCat](https://worldcat.org) - have a look.

## Educational resources
 * [slogwiki](http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/Main_Page) An open-edit encyclopedia dedicated to thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. 
 * [sagemath](http://www.sagemath.org/) a free open-source software for numerical and symbolic mathematics, ready with Jupyter notebook and wrappers for all kinds of tools.
 * [DoITPoMS](http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/) website has a section on [Ellingham Diagrams](http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/ellingham_diagrams/index.php).
 * The College of Engineering, San Jose State University has a tutorial page on [Ellingam Diagrams](http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/ellingham/tutorial.html). Play with the [webtool](http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/ellingham/ellingham_tool_p1.php) out there and see.
 * [Equilibrium of Things](https://blog.gtt-technologies.de/) blog

## Standards
 * [CALPHAD](http://www.calphad.org/) - the defacto standard for computational thermodynamics
 * [IUPAC](https://goldbook.iupac.org/terms/view/S05927) Gold Book on standard thermodynamic quantities

## Free / Opensource
 * [OpenCALPHAD](http://www.opencalphad.com/) - an effort to make the CALPHAD aproach opensource
