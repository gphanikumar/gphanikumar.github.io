# Solidification of high entropy alloys

High entropy alloys are being studied intensely in the recent times. Our studies are on the solidification of undercooled high entropy alloys. These alloys are prepared using arc melting, processed for undercooling using flux technique and then solidified to study microstructure, phase selection and growth rate of primary phase as a function of undercooling. These alloys are also being studied for their [hot deformation](gleeble.html) characteristics.

Using the ICME approach, we have designed a seven component eutectic high entropy alloy.
