# Hot deformation of materials

We have used Gleeble 3800 acquired by our Department through the DST-FIST program to perform hot deformation studies on a number of alloys. Some of these publications are first time in their class of materials, eg., eutectic high entropy alloys and cobalt based superalloys.Studies on high entropy alloys are using rods prepared using suction-casting from arc melting. Thus they represent useful studies to determine safe window of hot deformation of cast ingots. Flow curve data from Gleeble can be used in tabulated form for material property for large scale simulation using FEM packages such as Simufact-Forming &trade;.
