# Rapid solidification using meltspinning and undercooling


Undercooling of melts using electromagnetic levitation work was possible at IIT Madras because of the experimental setup was sponsored by the Space Science Office of the Indian Space Research Organization under the National Microgravity Programme. The setup was assembled and commissioned with the help of my students [Gerald](students/gerald.html) and [Prasad](students/rvsprasad.html) in the lab. Work on this setup is part of the doctoral thesis of [Prasad](students/rvsprasad.html) and [Hrusikesh](students/hrusikesh.html) and project theses of [Mathew](students/mathew.html), [Reshma](students/reshma.html) and [Harsha](students/harsha.html)

A vacuum arc melting unit to prepare buttons of alloy samples has also been designed, assembled and commissioned in the lab.
