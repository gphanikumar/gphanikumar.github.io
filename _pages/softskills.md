# Soft skills for Research

## Why soft skills?

  * Extra skills necessary for efficiency
  * Time and efficiency is crucial for progress and meeting deadlines
  * Presentation skills are a must
  * Free/lag time is the opportunity to pick them
  * Sometimes ideas come from how extensive your toolkit is!

## Organizing your data 

  * Keeping data organized and retrievable
  * Concept of Spread sheets
  * Format of cells, locking, sorting
  * Built-in functions
  * Export to csv, txt for data safety and portability
  * Sometimes Excel is not preferred for data safety

** spread sheet software **

  * [[http://www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html|OpenOffice.org Calc]] (free)
  * [[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/FX010858001033.aspx|Microsoft Excel]]
  * [[http://www.originlab.com|Origin]]
  * [[http://www.systat.com/products/SigmaPlot/|SigmaPlot]]

===== Databases =====

  * Data management for literature, searchable information
  * Think big, modular and growable

==== Database software ====

  * [[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/FX010857911033.aspx|Microsoft access]] for windows platform. Not free.
  * [[http://www.mysql.org|MySQL]] with [[http://phpmyadmin.net|phpMyAdmin]] over [[http://www.apache.org|apache server]] for any platform. These are open source software and free of cost.

===== Numerical analysis =====

  * Solution of linear set of equations
  * Numerical Integration, differentiation
  * Matrix operations
  * Image processing
  * Normalization, statistical analysis
  * Power of scripts over clicks !!!
  * Learn a (free) language of your choice. Make sure the compiler is available easily. 

** Low level programming languages **

It is a good idea to choose to learn a language for which the compiler or the software is available for all platforms 
  * [[public:fortran:start|Fortran]] language, a must for computational science.
  * [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language|c programming language]]: The wikipedia site has lot of useful links and information. [[http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/|gcc]] compiler is free, robust, opensource and available for all platforms.
  * c++

** High level programming environments **
  * [[http://www.mathworks.com/|Matlab]]: object oriented programming language and a commercial package for all platforms.
  * [[http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/|Octave]]: Open source software and free of cost for all platforms. Almost like matlab.
  * [[http://www.scilab.org|SciLab]]: Open source software and free of cost for all platforms.

** Scripting languages **
  * [[http://www.perl.org/|perl]]: object oriented programming language for scripts, pattern matching and extracting. Available freely for all platforms.
  * [[http://www.python.org|python]]: object oriented programming language available free for all platforms. Particularly useful for numerical computation.

===== Post-processing =====

  * Plotting: 2D, 3D, 4D
  * Rendering : Mesh, Surface, Colormap, Contours, Streamlines, Quivers etc.,
  * Image formats: Vector, Raster
    * Vector: wmf, emf, ps, eps, pdf, psd
    * Raster: jpg, gif, png, tiff
    * Transparency: gif, png, most vector formats
  * Concept of bits in raster image formats

Use of software like gnuplot, matlab, mayavi, opendx, paraview etc. to visualize data.
==== Software ====
  * [[http://www.mathworks.com/|Matlab]]: Commercial software for all platforms.
  * [[http://www.originlab.com|Origin]]: Commercial software for windows platform.
  * [[http://www.systat.com/products/SigmaPlot/|SigmaPlot]]
  * [[http://www.tecplot.com/|Tecplot]]: Commercial software for all platforms. Particularly useful for CFD.
  * [[http://www.gnuplot.info/|Gnuplot]]: Open source software for all platforms, free of cost.
  * [[http://www.visualstats.org/|viSta]]: An excellent software for statistical data analysis, ViSta  (Visual Statistics, Seeing Data with Dynamic Interactive Graphics) is available free.

===== Working with analytical expressions =====

  * Mathematics is the language of engineers
  * Nature of functions, Minima, Maxima, Integration, Differentiation etc.,
  * Tools:
    * [[http://www.maple.com/|Maple]]: First symbolic computation software.
    * [[http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/index.html|Mathematica]]: User friendly symbolic computation software.


===== Writing it up =====

When you write an article or your thesis, check out if you are able to do the following.

  * Tables, Figures with captions and auto-numbering
  * References and cross-references with auto-numbering and sequencing
  * Table of contents, list of tables, list of figures, list of References to be inserted automatically
  * Equations and symbols that dont change their appearance from machine to machine
  * Page setup that is configurable from chapter to chapter and does not change from machine to machine

==== Software ====

  * [[http://www.openoffice.org/product/writer.html|OpenOffice.Org Writer]]: WYSIWYG interface, for all platforms, open source and free of cost.
  * [[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/FX010857991033.aspx|Microsoft Word]]: WYSIWYG interface, for windows platform, commercial.
  * [[http://www.ctan.org/|Latex]]: Programmable, available for all platforms, open source and free of cost for professional looking output. Warning: you may need to use your brain. Take a look at [[http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/|who]] wrote it.

===== Other tools =====

  * Digitizing data from literature: e.g., Windig
  * Schematics and Flow charts: e.g., OpenOffice.Org Dia, Draw, Microsoft Word as a drawing tool, xfig
  * Accurate diagrams: autoCAD etc.,
  * Working with a server: eXceed to display remote windows on your m/c
