# Knowledge representation in materials domain using ontology

The ecosystem for knowledge representation, editing, retrieval, reasoning and querying is now mature thanks to OWL 2.0 standard, Protege, Pellet and SPARQL tools such as apache-jena-fuseki. Some of the initial work on this is documented at the following GitHub repository.

[Materials Ontologies](https://github.com/gphanikumar/materialsontologies)

The [credits](https://github.com/gphanikumar/MaterialsOntologies/blob/master/credits.md) for this work, and documentation of the ontologies are on GitHub: [ConceptOnto](https://github.com/gphanikumar/MaterialsOntologies/blob/master/doc/ConceptOnto.md)

We are building a heroku based app to help browse the ontologies. Check it out at the following URL:
