# Thermal field and distortion analysis using SYSWELD速 

This work is in collaboration with Prof. N. Siva Prasad (retired from Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Madras) (ME) and was sponsored by a project from DST. The work is part of doctoral theses of [Shirish](students/shirish.html) and [Lakshminarayanan](students/klnaren.html) and M.Tech theses of [J. Dhananjeyan](students/dhan.html) and [Santhosh](students/santhosh.html). The M.S.(by research) thesis of [M.R. Rahul](students/rahulmr.html) was on combining SYSWELD速 simulations with physical simulations using Gleeble速 3800.
