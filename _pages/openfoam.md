# Simulations using OpenFOAM

In our group, we have migrated from legacy codes in fortran and C to OpenFOAM for CFD based simulations. We now have solvers for welding, additive manufacturing, vacuum arc remelting and continuous casting using the OpenFOAM libraries. We are currently developing solvers using phase-field method using OpenFOAM.

The project works [Balavignesh](students/balavignesh.html) and [Satyam](students/satyam.html) is using OpenFOAM. Thesis work of [Tejaswi](students/tejaswi.html) is on OpenFOAM.
