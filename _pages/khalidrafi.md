![Rafi](../assets/images/khalidrafi.jpeg)  
Roll No: MM08D002  
Jointly guided by Prof. K. Prasad Rao   
Thesis title: Studies on solid state coatings by friction surfacing   
Rafi defended thesis on May 31, 2011.   
Currently Rafi is doing his post-doctoral research with Dr. Brent Stucker in Utah on additive manufacturing.
Rafi's work started the area of friction surfacing in the lab. His thesis has led to a number of publications as listed below.
