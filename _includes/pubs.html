	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The effect of replacement of molybdenum with small amount of tungsten on the stability of cobalt based superalloys of Co–Ni–Mo–Al–Ta–Ti class has been presented. A small addition of tungsten (W) in Co–30Ni–(5-x)Mo–10Al–2Ta–2Ti–2W alloys stabilizes the cuboidal morphology of precipitates and increases the γ′ volume fraction. A 2 at% addition of W causes an increase of 60 °C in solvus temperature of the base superalloy to reach a value of 1130 °C with a slight increase of mass density to 8.79 g/cc. Beside partitioning into γ′, W also shifts the partitioning preference of Mo from the γ′ phase in 0W alloy to that of equal partitioning in both γ and γ’ phases in 2W alloy. An interfacial confinement of Mo atoms could be observed at the γ/γ′ interfaces that reduces interface energy leading to enhanced microstructural stability. The experimentally determined temporal evolution of average precipitate size in the 2W alloy at the temperatures of 800, 900 and 950 °C suggests a matrix diffusion limited coarsening kinetics. The estimated coarsening rate constant at 900 °C follows a quasi-steady state model and is comparable to those observed for W and Re containing Co-based superalloys. The activation energy for γ′ precipitate coarsening is estimated to be 258 ± 6 kJ/mole, which is comparable to the Mo diffusion in the γ-Co matrix suggesting Mo diffusion still controls the precipitate coarsening in the 2W alloy.</td>

The hot deformation behaviours have been investigated at a temperature ranging from 1073 to 1273 K and different strain rates (10−3,10−2,10−1and 1 s−1). The optimum hot workability conditions of EHEA lies in temperature range 1073–1273 K and strain rate range 10−3 s−1-10−1.6 s−1 as well as temperature 1130–1225K and strain rate 10−0.5-1 s−1. The constitutive relation is established to understand the plastic deformability at high temperature. Finite element simulation has also been used to predict the deformation behaviour during the hot working process.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: An integrated computational materials engineering (ICME)-based workflow was adopted for the study of microstructure and property evolution at the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of gas metal arc-welded DP980 steel. The macroscale simulation of the welding process was performed with finite element method (FEM) implemented in Simufact Welding® software and was experimentally validated. The time–temperature profile at HAZ obtained from FEM simulation was physically simulated using Gleeble 3800® thermo-mechanical simulator with a dilatometer attachment. The resulting phase transformations and microstructure were studied experimentally. The austenite-to-ferrite and austenite-to-bainite transformations during cooling at HAZ were simulated using the Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov (JMAK) equation implemented in JMatPro® software and with phase-field modeling implemented in Micress® software. The phase fractions and the phase transformation kinetics simulated by phase-field method agreed well with experiments. A single scaling factor introduced in JMatPro® software minimized the deviation between calculations and experiments. Asymptotic homogenization implemented in Homat® software was used to calculate the effective macroscale thermo-elastic properties from the phase-field simulated microstructure. FEM-based virtual uniaxial tensile test with Abaqus® software was used to calculate the effective macroscale flow curves from the phase-field simulated microstructure. The flow curve from virtual test simulation showed good agreement with the flow curve obtained with tensile test in Gleeble®. An ICME-based vertical integration workflow in two stages is proposed. With this ICME workflow, effective properties at the macroscale could be obtained by taking microstructure morphology and orientation into consideration.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Equiatomic RNi (where R = Gd, Ho and Er) compounds have been prepared by undercooling. Magnetization data confirm ferromagnetic ordering of the samples at 69 K, 35 K and 10 K (TC) respectively. Magnetocaloric effect (MCE) has been estimated in terms of isothermal magnetic entropy change (ΔSm) near TC. The maximum ΔSm value (ΔSmmax) for 50 kOe field change is about −18 Jkg-1K−1, −20 Jkg-1K−1 and −30 Jkg-1K−1 respectively near TC for the undercooled RNi (R = Gd, Ho and Er) compounds. The ΔSmmax value is more than that obtained for the same compounds prepared by arc-melting and melt-spinning techniques. The observed enhancement in MCE of the undercooled samples could be due to the improved purity that results in faster change of magnetization around the magnetic transition. Thus undercooling rare earth intermetallics and alloys seems to be an attractive, alternative method to synthesize magnetocaloric materials.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The case hardening process (carburizing followed by quenching to room temperature) is one of the heat treatments routinely conducted in various industrial sectors. Depending on the parameters applied during the post-carburizing stage, different microstructural constituents may develop in the interior (core) section of a case-hardened component which substantially influence the overall mechanical properties. In the present work, the effects of different heat treatments following the carburizing stage on the core microstructure evolution, the resulting toughness and hardness properties were investigated. The heat treatments were carried out employing Navy C-ring specimens, the core of which were used for microstructural investigations and fabrication of mini-Charpy specimens. Besides, nanoindentation tests were also carried out in the same region to examine the local hardness of different constituents. Furthermore, the microstructural evolutions were also studied utilizing multi-phase field modeling. Based on the obtained results, it can be shown that the increase in fractions of bainite and retained austenite is in direct correlation with the impact toughness improvement, however, the increase in fraction of ferrite and martensite acts inversely. Moreover, despite the differences in fractions of constituents, the level of overall hardness is similar in all the developed microstructures. Additionally, the nanoindentation results revealed that the formation of large fraction of bainitic ferrite leads to high level of scattering in nanohardness of martensite. Phase field simulations show that this is attributed to the degree of carbon partitioning into the adjacent austenitic area where depending on the local morphology and size can be quite different.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In recent years, several multicomponent alloys of near equiatomic composition (also known as high-entropy alloys) with excellent mechanical properties have been developed. In this study, a eutectic high entropy alloy, CoCrFeNiNb0.45, was chosen for a hot deformation study. The alloy consists of a primary face-centered cubic (FCC) phase (CoCrFeNi rich) and a eutectic region between the FCC and Laves phase (Co2Nb type). The combination of FCC and eutectic region is expected to provide better strength and ductility. Hot compression tests were carried out at different strain rates of 0.001, 0.1, 1, and 10 s−1 with varying temperatures of 1,073, 1,173, 1,273, and 1,323 K. The optimum processing window was identified by plotting processing maps, and the instability region was verified using multiple parameters. Constitutive equation relating stress, strain rate, and temperature is established. The optimum processing condition was correlated with the microstructural characterization, and instability was characterized with cracks on the specimen. Finite element simulation was carried out, taking the flow curve as input and correlating the strain field distribution with the microhardness variation. These studies are intended to contribute to an integrated computational materials engineering approach to developing these alloys toward a product.</td>

The desirable phase α−Nb5Si3 phase could be obtained in alloys containing 4 at. % or more Zr. Nanoindentation results showed that the elastic modulus of Nbss phase is not significantly influenced by Zr additions whereas elastic modulus of Nb3Si and α−Nb5Si3phases are considerably improved by Zr additions. The strength, plasticity and room temperature fracture toughness of the alloys are significantly increased with Zr addition. The maximum compressive strength of 2160 ± 80 MPa, plastic strain of 2.6 ± 0.2% and fracture toughness of 14.3 ± 0.3MPam1/2are achieved in alloy with 4 at.% Zr.</td>

These parameters affected heat input generation in the welds, thereby influencing stir zone geometry, grain size evolution in stir zone, tensile properties and hardness of the weld. Low tool rotation speed and high travel speed resulted in finer grain size. Travel speed significantly affected the tensile properties compared to rotation speed.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In the design of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) with desired properties, identifying the effects of elements plays an important role. HEAs with eutectic microstructure can be obtained by judiciously modifying the alloy compositions. In this study, the effect of Nb addition to FeCoNiCuNbx (x = 0.5, 5, 7.5, 11.6, 15) alloys was studied by varying the Nb concentration (at.%). FeCoNiCuNb0.5 HEA shows liquid phase separation to form Cu-rich and FeCoNiCu-rich phases. Detailed solidification paths are proposed for these alloys, which show eutectic, peritectic, and pseudo quasi-peritectic reactions. Increasing Nb content promotes the liquid phase separation tendency and causes the formation of Cu-rich spheres. The effect of Nb on the FeCoNiCu-rich phase was studied based on the nanoindentation and correlated with nanohardness. The compressive deformation properties of these alloys are studied at room temperature and high temperature and correlated with microstructure. Fractography results show the mode of fracture and are correlated with the microstructure obtained.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Recently, cobalt-based γ-γ′ microstructured superalloys have attracted attention. However, studies on their processing behavior [i.e., processing maps (the variation of strain rate sensitivity (m) with temperature)] are limited. Thus, the high-temperature flow behavior of a γ-γ′ Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta-2Ti-5Cr (at. pct) superalloy was investigated using isothermal compression tests between 1348 and 1498 K at strain rates from 0.001 to 10 s−1. The m contour map was generated using the experimental flow stress values, which were used to locate the optimum hot workability and desired microstructural processing range. A strong dependence of m on the deformation parameters (temperature, strain rate, and strain) was observed. A maximum m value of around 0.3 at 1460 K to 1498 K and strain rates of 0.01 to 0.5 s−1 was found. The deformed samples show a fully recrystallized microstructure at high m. Unstable domains showed the formation of cavities at the grain boundary triple points and cracks along the grain boundaries at high strain rates (1 to 10 s−1), corresponding to m < 0.10. A constitutive model was developed using an Arrhenius hyperbolic sine function, yielding an apparent activation energy of 540 ± 30 kJ mol−1 for hot deformation. This study indicates reasonable formability under certain conditions below the solvus, thus opening possibilities for further thermomechanical treatment.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Dual phase steel is one of the future materials for automobile industry, as it shows a combination of high strength and adequate formability. Studies have shown that it has the potential to occupy up to 80% of the total weight of a car. Residual stress during heat treatments is one of the issues that need to be studied in dual phase steel and computational simulations can help in reducing the experimental trials required for such a study. The heat transfer simulation in such a material is challenging, as it involves phase transformation at the microscale. In the present work, an attempt is made to incorporate the effect of phase transformation at the microscale while simulating the macroscale heat transfer and consequent residual stress. A novel and simple flat geometry is chosen for study that helps in easy measurement of residual stresses. The geometry is a rectangular strip with an elliptical hole and the role played by the angle of elliptical hole on residual stress prediction is discussed. Finite Element simulation of the heat transfer and the subsequent residual stress is performed using the commercial software Simufact Forming®. The effect of microscale phase transformations on the residual stress was considered during the software simulations. These simulations are validated using physical simulations in Gleeble® and measurement of macroscale residual stress with X-Ray diffraction technique.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The present investigation reports phase and microstructure evolution during solidification of novel Ni-rich Ni-Ti-based alloys, Ni60Ti40, Ni50Cu10Ti40, Ni48Cu10Co2Ti40, and Ni48Cu10Co2Ti38Ta2 during suction casting. The design philosophy of the multicomponent alloys involves judicious selection of alloying elements such as Cu, Co, and Ta in the near Ni60Ti40 eutectic alloy by replacing both Ni and Ti so that phase mixture in the microstructure remains the same from the binary to quinary alloy. The basic objective is to study the effect of addition of Cu, Co, and Ta on the phase evolution and transformation in the Ni-rich Ni-Ti-based alloys. The detailed electron microscopic studies on these suction cast alloys reveal the presence of ultrafine eutectic lamellae between NiTi and Ni3Ti phases along with dendritic NiTi and Ti2Ni phases. It has also been observed that in the binary (Ni60Ti40) alloy, the ordered NiTi (B2) phase transforms to trigonal (R) phase followed by NiTi martensitic phase (M-phase), i.e., B2 → R-phase → M-phase during solid-state cooling. However, the addition of alloying elements such as Cu, Co to the binary (Ni60Ti40) alloy suppresses the martensitic transformation of the ordered NiTi (B2) dendrite. Thus, in the ternary and quaternary alloys, the ordered NiTi (B2) phase is transformed to only trigonal (R) phase, i.e., B2 → R-phase. The secondary precipitate of Ti2Ni has been observed in all of the studied alloys. Interestingly, Ni48Cu10Co2Ti38Ta2 quinary alloy shows the disordered nature of NiTi dendrites. The experimentally observed solidification path is in good agreement with Gulliver–Scheil simulated path for binary alloy, whereas simulated solidification path deviates from the experimental results in case of ternary, quaternary, and quinary alloys.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Welding process with trailing heat sink for 2 mm mild steel plates<br>	has been analyzed to estimate distortion and residual stresses using<br>	a finite element modeling software Sysweld. The material properties<br>	used for the analysis are both temperature dependent and phase dependent.<br>	A transient thermal analysis is carried out using Goldak double ellipsoidal<br>	heat source model and heat sink as Gaussian model with negative heat<br>	flux. The finite element analysis (FEA) is conducted by considering<br>	the material properties of all phases of steel as well as without<br>	phase transformation i.e. by considering properties of only ferrite<br>	phase. Temperature distribution, distortion and residual stresses<br>	are calculated and compared for four cases: without phase without<br>	cooling, without phase with cooling, with phase without cooling and<br>	with phase with cooling. It is found that FEA without phase transformation<br>	effects overestimates the residual stresses in the fusion zone (FZ)<br>	and heat affected zone (HAZ). It is also found that a trailing heat<br>	sink reduces transverse compressive residual stresses thus minimizing<br>	the possibilities of buckling.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Weld distortion and residual stresses are two major issues in the<br>	fabrication process. Numerical techniques are being tried out to<br>	accurately predict the structural integrity of the welding. Interpass<br>	time in the multipass welding is an important parameter which influences<br>	the weld distortion and residual stresses. In this study two pass<br>	tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding of 6 mm mild steel plates has been<br>	analyzed using Finite element analysis (FEA) software Sysweld and<br>	parametric study is conducted with different interpass time. The<br>	temperature distribution, distortion and residual stresses are calculated<br>	using three dimensional finite element model (FEM) considering phase<br>	transformations in the material. The transient thermo-metallurgical<br>	analysis followed by elasto-plastic analysis is carried out using<br>	temperature dependent and phase dependent material properties. The<br>	material deposition in the multipass welding is numerically simulated<br>	using chewing gum method, where dummy phase and dummy material are<br>	assigned for the element activation. The phase proportions are calculated<br>	by assigning suitable phase kinetics parameter extracted from continuous<br>	cooling transformation (CCT) diagram of a given material. Experiments<br>	are conducted for validation after given edge preparation and using<br>	same material as filler wire. The FEM analysis is carried out for<br>	eight cases with different time interval between passes, starting<br>	from 30 s to 240 s in the steps of 30 s. FEM results are verified<br>	with experimentally measured values. It is found that the time interval<br>	between passes has less influence on the residual stresses but significantly<br>	affects the distortion and phase proportion due to the first pass<br>	preheating effect on second pass and second pass postheating effect<br>	on first pass.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Although the grain-refinement practice is well established for wrought<br>	Al alloys, in the case of foundry alloys such as near eutectic Al-Si<br>	alloys, the underlying mechanisms and the use of grain refiners need<br>	better understanding. Conventional grain refiners such as Al-5Ti-1B<br>	are not effective in grain refining the Al-Si alloys due to the poisoning<br>	effect of Si. In this work, we report the results of a newly developed<br>	grain refiner, which can effectively grain refine as well as modify<br>	eutectic and primary Si in near eutectic Al-Si alloys. Among the<br>	material choices, the grain refining response with Al-1Ti-3B master<br>	alloy is found to be superior compared to the conventional Al-5Ti-1B<br>	master alloy. It was also found that magnesium additions of 0.2 wt<br>	pct along with the Al-1Ti-3B master alloy further enhance the near<br>	eutectic Al-Si alloy's grain refining efficiency, thus leading to<br>	improved bulk mechanical properties. We have found that magnesium<br>	essentially scavenges the oxygen present on the surface of nucleant<br>	particles, improves wettability, and reduces the agglomeration tendency<br>	of boride particles, thereby enhancing grain refining efficiency.<br>	It allows the nucleant particles to act as potent and active nucleation<br>	sites even at levels as low as 0.2 pct in the Al-1Ti-3B master alloy.<br>	© 2011 The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society and ASM International.</td>

Simultaneous induction heating of the billet<br>	during stirring was quantified using experimentally determined thermal<br>	profiles.

Corresponding computational modeling of the process<br>	was performed using phase-field modeling of alloy solidification<br>	in order to gain insight into the process of morphological changes<br>	of a solid during this process. A non-isothermal alloy solidification<br>	model was used for simulations. The morphological evolution under<br>	such imposed thermal cycles was simulated and compared with experimentally<br>	determined one. Suitable scaling using the thermosolutal diffusion<br>	distances was used to overcome computational difficulties in quantitative<br>	comparison at system scale.

For instance, growth velocity<br>	data for nickel melts obtained with a high-speed camera system [D.M.<br>	Matson, in: Solidification 1998, TMS, Warrendale PA, 1998, p. 233]<br>	show higher values at low undercoolings than data obtained with the<br>	CPS. Within this work new measurements of dendritic growth velocity<br>	in levitated undercooled nickel samples were performed as a function<br>	of undercooling ΔT to investigate this discrepancy. Solidification<br>	of the undercooled melt was detected at undercooling levels within<br>	the range of 30 K<ΔT<300 K. The new data reveal high accuracy and<br>	low scattering. These data are compared with two independent growth<br>	velocity data sets and discrepancies are discussed. For verification<br>	of the new CPS data dendrite growth velocity was also measured by<br>	using a high-speed camera where the morphology of the intersection<br>	of the solidification front with the sample surface was investigated.<br>	The new experimental data are analyzed within the model of dendrite<br>	growth obtained on the basis of Brener's theory [E. Brener, J.

The study presents<br>	a characterization of the microstructure and mechanical properties<br>	of the welds. Detailed microstructural analysis of the weld/ base-metal<br>	interface shows features that are different on the two sides of the<br>	weld. The iron side can grow into the weld with a local change in<br>	length scale, whereas the interface on the copper side indicates<br>	a barrier to growth. The interface is jagged, and a banded microstructure<br>	consisting of iron-rich layers could be observed next to the weld/Cu<br>	interface. The observations suggest that solidification initiates<br>	inside the melt, where iron and copper are mixed due to convective<br>	flow. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the weld region<br>	also indicates the occasional presence of droplets of iron and copper.<br>	The microstructural observations are rationalized using arguments<br>	drawn from a thermodynamic analysis of the Fe-Cu system.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The present investigation explores the possibility of synthesizing<br>	a two-phase microstructure consisting of a fine dispersion of bismuth<br>	particles in an aluminium matrix using the laser surface alloying<br>	technique.

The<br>	microstructural analysis of the surface alloyed samples shows that<br>	the average size of the bismuth particles reduces with increase in<br>	laser scan speed. In order to understand the factors that determine<br>	the nature of the size distribution of the particles, a detailed<br>	model is developed. The model incorporates heat and fluid flow induced<br>	by the laser to arrive at the evolution of the temperature and velocity<br>	of the melt in three dimensions. Using these as inputs, a kinetic<br>	analysis of the nucleation, growth and coarsening induced by collision-controlled<br>	coalescence of the bismuth particles from the melt is carried out.<br>	Comparison with the experiments indicates that coalescence due to<br>	convection plays an important role in the evolution of the size distribution<br>	of bismuth particles. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In order to obtain basic understanding of microstructure evolution<br>	in laser-surface-alloyed layers, aluminum was surface alloyed on<br>	a pure nickel substrate using a CO2 laser. By varying the laser scanning<br>	speed, the composition of the surface layers can be systematically<br>	varied. The Ni content in the layer increases with increase in scanning<br>	speed. Detailed cross-sectional transmission electron microscopic<br>	study reveals complexities in solidification behavior with increased<br>	nickel content. It is shown that ordered B2 phase forms over a wide<br>	range of composition with subsequent precipitation of Ni2Al, an ordered<br>	ω phase in the B2 matrix, during solid-state cooling. For nickel-rich<br>	alloys associated with higher laser scan speed, the fcc γ phase is<br>	invariably the first phase to grow from the liquid with solute trapping.<br>	The phase reorders in the solid state to yield γ′ Ni3Al. The phase<br>	competes with β AlNi, which forms massively from the liquid. The<br>	β AlNi transforms martensitically to a 3R structure during cooling<br>	in solid state. The results can be rationalized in terms of a metastable<br>	phase diagram proposed earlier. However, the results are at variance<br>	with earlier studies of laser processing of nickel-rich alloys.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, a three-dimensional transient macroscopic numerical<br>	model is developed for the description of transport phenomena during<br>	laser surface alloying. In order to make accurate estimates for the<br>	species composition distribution during the process, the addition<br>	of alloying elements is formulated by devising a species generation<br>	term for the solute transport equation. By employing a particle-tracking<br>	algorithm and a simultaneous particle-melting consideration, the<br>	species source term is estimated by the amount of fusion of a spherical<br>	particle as it passes through a particular control volume. Numerical<br>	simulations are performed for two cases. The first case corresponds<br>	to aluminium as alloying element on a nickel substrate, while the<br>	second case is for alloying nickel on aluminium substrate. It is<br>	observed for the latter case that the melting of the alloying element<br>	is not instantaneous, and hence it cannot be modelled as a species<br>	mass flux boundary condition at the top surface. The predicted results<br>	are compared with experiments, and the agreement is found to be good.<br>	© 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The transport phenomena (heat transfer, fluid flow and species distribution)<br>	are numerically modelled for the case of laser welding of dissimilar<br>	metals. The model involves convection in the weld pool along with<br>	melting and mixing. The associated metallurgical phenomenon is an<br>	extremely complex one, and the present work is a preliminary attempt<br>	to model the process after making suitable assumptions. The numerical<br>	study is performed using a pressure based finite volume technique<br>	after making appropriate modifications to the algorithm to include<br>	the associated phase change processes and dissimilarity in the metal<br>	properties. The phase change process is modelled using an enthalpy-porosity<br>	technique, while the dissimilar metal properties are handled using<br>	appropriate mixture theories. As a case study, we have used dissimilar<br>	couples of copper-nickel. It is observed that the weld pool shape<br>	becomes asymmetric even when the heat source is symmetrically applied<br>	on the two metals forming the couple. As the weld pool develops,<br>	the side melting earlier is found to experience more convection and<br>	better mixing. Corresponding experiments are performed using the<br>	same parameters as in the computations, showing a good qualitative<br>	agreement between the two results. A scale analysis is performed<br>	to predict the time scale of initiation of melting of each metal.<br>	The scale-analysis predictions show a good agreement with the numerical<br>	results.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In the present article, evolution of microstructure during solidification,<br>	as a function of various parameters, is discussed. Macrosegregation<br>	is described as being due to insufficient diffusivity of solute in<br>	the solid. Pattern formation is discussed in the light of instabilities<br>	at the solidification growth front. An overview of the scaling relations<br>	for various microstructures is given. Metastable extensions to equilibrium<br>	phase diagrams and corrections to equilibrium quantities are described.</td>
