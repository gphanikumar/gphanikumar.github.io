	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In aerospace industries, optimisation of the welding process parameters is crucial to achieve high-performance welds in superalloy. The current study develops an integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) framework for the Electron Beam Welding (EBW) process optimisation of XH67MBTЮ Ni-based superalloy. The thermal field was established using FEM simulation. The microstructure in the fusion zone was simulated using the phase field method and validated using experimental data. The Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) microstructure was predicted using kinetic calculation and validated using the physical simulation followed by experimental microstructural characterisation. The TEM studies confirm the formation of Cr-rich and Ti-rich carbides in the HAZ thermal cycle simulated samples. A hot ductility curve was established for the studied alloy, and this can guide the restraint condition for welding. Finally, an ICME framework is suggested and validated for the EB welding optimisation.</td>

Sharp interface models via interface response functions have been used earlier to explain the microstructure selection under such solidification conditions. However, most of the sharp interface models assume linear superposition of contributions of alloying elements without considering the non-linearity associated with the phase diagram. In this report, both planar and dendritic Calphad coupled sharp interface models have been implemented and used to explain the growth-controlled phase selection observed at high solidification velocities relevant to additive manufacturing. The implemented model predicted the growth-controlled phase selection in multicomponent alloys, which the other models with linear phase diagram could not.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Haynes 282 is a weldable, gamma-prime strengthened Ni-based superalloy and is a suitable candidate for aerospace and power-generation applications. Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of Haynes 282 is gaining attention recently due to its superior mechanical properties than its conventional counterparts. In spite of the superior mechanical properties, there are significant challenges concerning crystallographic anisotropy. One of the critical but less studied parameters that influence crystallographic anisotropy is the laser scan rotation angle. This study investigates the effect of laser scan rotation angle on the microstructure and subsequently on the mechanical properties. The samples fabricated with 90° scan rotation exhibited stronger texture while the samples with 137° rotation had weaker texture than samples with 67°. Further, three-dimensional Finite difference-Monte Carlo simulations were performed to understand the microstructure evolution with varying process parameters. The experimental and simulated microstructures are quantitatively compared using 2-point correlations. The texture and grain morphology evolution are explained based on melt pool morphology and microstructure simulations. Mechanical properties of as-built and aged samples are estimated using theoretical models and agree well with the experimental results.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Higher capacity materials, such as Si and Sn are known to have phase separating behavior during the (de)lithiation. While initial models for lithiation in graphite electrode were based on single phase diffusion, with the introduction of Si and Sn, disposition of the models has shifted to the two-phase diffusion. It is important to understand the interaction of various phenomenon in materials which show phase change during (dis)charging cycles. In this work, we present a phase field model to simulate two-phase lithiation. This model is used to study the electrochemical response of the system by conducting numerical voltammetry. The main goal of this effort is to highlight the difference in electrochemical response occurring during single-phase diffusion and two-phase diffusion and explain the ensuing physics. Furthermore, effect of elasticity which governs the phase-change process and also alters corresponding voltammograms is also studied in detail. The voltammograms show clear shift in current peaks' size and position for the changing diffusion behavior. Also as elasticity affects the two-phase diffusion, change in nucleation timing and diffusion rate are visible in voltammograms. Additionally, it is also observed how elasticity can cease the phase separation behavior and voltammogram for two-phase diffusion can become identical to single-phase diffusion.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The increasing demand for higher energy capacity in lithium-ion batteries has underscored the significance of modeling lithiation with alternative electrode materials, such as silicon (Si) and tin (Sn). This research addresses the need for comprehensive insights into the (dis)charging process, particularly focusing on the intricate phase transformations in the anode. Phase-field modeling has proven effective in capturing these transformations [2], revealing volumetric deformations of up to 300% during (dis)charging cycles [1]. Unfortunately, these deformations compromise material integrity, leading to reduced battery cycle life and reliability.<p>To address these challenges, our work presents a novel framework for modeling lithiation in materials exhibiting two-phase diffusion using phase field modeling. Unlike previous models limited to single-phase diffusion, our framework provides a more realistic representation of the diffusion process. This realism is achieved by incorporating the time-dependent voltage applied to the anode, a crucial factor in understanding the electrochemical response during lithiation [3].<p>Furthermore, we leverage the currents generated during the lithiation and delithiation processes to conduct a comprehensive voltammetric study. This study goes beyond existing research by considering the impact of phase separation on the currents developed during Li-ion battery operation. Our findings aim to contribute valuable insights into optimizing battery performance and addressing challenges associated with phase transformations, ultimately advancing the development of high-capacity anodes for lithium-ion batteries.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: This study explores the potential of cold spray technology for repairing high-strength Al7075 alloy components, particularly in the aerospace industry. The gas-atomized powder contains a dendritic cell structure with solutes segregated at the dendritic cell boundaries. Thus, direct aging of atomized powder fails to induce the formation of strengthened precipitates. Therefore, the effect of different powder pre-treatments on the deposition efficiency, microstructure, and aging behavior of the coatings was investigated. Cold spray coatings were deposited using as-received powder, solutionized, and solutionized + aged powders, revealing a significant improvement in thickness for coatings obtained using solutionized (110%) and solutionized + aged (80%) powders compared to the coating from the as-received atomized powder. Further, coatings deposited using as-received, solutionized, and solutionized + aged powders, were aged at 120 °C for various durations and the aging response of different coatings were studied. Microstructural studies revealed that gas-atomized powders exhibited dendritic structures with segregated solutes. Solutionizing eliminated the dendritic features, promoting deposition efficiency upon cold spraying. Aging of the coating from the solutionized powder led to the formation of ultrafine η' precipitates (29 ± 8 nm length, 2 ± 1 nm diameter) at peak-aged condition (after 8 h). These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of powder pre-treatment in tailoring the microstructure and deposition behavior of cold-sprayed Al7075 coatings, offering a promising approach for repair applications.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The addition of Zn to AlCrFeCoNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) poses intriguing questions as to how it would affect phase evolution. Herein, the phase evolution in AlCrFeCoNiZn is studied using a combination of experimental techniques (X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry) and computational (density-functional theory [DFT], calculation of phase diagrams, and machine-learning) methods. Mechanically alloyed and spark-plasma-sintered AlCrFeCoNiZn assumes a metastable single-phase, body-centered-cubic (BCC) structure that undergoes diffusion-controlled phase separation upon subsequent heat treatment to form separate (Al, Cr)-rich, (Fe, Co)-rich, and (Zn, Ni)-rich phases. The formation of (Al, Cr)-rich phase, not reported previously in AlCrFeCoNi-based HEAs, is attributed to strong clustering tendency of Cr–Zn and Cr–Ni pairs, combined with the strong ordering of Zn–Ni pair, driving out Cr that in turn combines with Al to form a (Al, Cr)-rich phase. In the DFT results, the formation of thermodynamically stable L12 phase is shown wherein Cr–Fe–Zn [Al–Ni-Co] preferably occupy1a (000) [3c (0 ½ ½)] positions. The sluggish diffusional transformation to L12 phase from BCC precursors is attributed to the small stacking-fault energy of AlCrFeCoNiZn. The equilibrated HEA exhibits a high microhardness of 8.24 GPa with an elastic modulus of 184 GPa.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: During the laser powder bed fusion(L-PBF) process, the rapid solidification conditions coupled with repeated heating and cooling cycles constrain the design potential and printability of complex-shaped structures, especially for part-scale components. Process-induced residual stress, porosity, and crystallographic texture are the most challenging obstacles when designing quality components using this process. These defects also have a detrimental impact on the quality and structural durability of the deposited parts. To comprehend the coupled effect of these determinants on the mechanical performance of various orientated components, we perform a sequentially coupled thermo-mechanical simulation to obtain the residual stress evolution during the deposition as well as on printed coupons after the extraction of the support structure. Simulated outcomes have been verified using X-ray diffraction, and there is a good convergence between simulated and experimental values with a 10% maximum difference. X-ray tomography and Electron back scattered diffraction(EBSD) techniques were utilized to quantify the process-induced porosity(distribution and size) and crystallographic texture in the solidified component, respectively. The mechanical performance of the deposited components was evaluated using uniaxial tensile tests. The cracking behavior in fractured samples was studied using SEM-based fractography. Due to more number of repeated thermal cycles, the vertically deposited sample had higher residual stress, larger grains, and thus lower strength.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: High-pressure die casting (HPDC) is a widely used process with short cycle times to manufacture complex shapes of aluminium castings for the automotive industry. Most of the die casting companies use specialized commercial software to simulate molten metal filling and solidification. This approach works satisfactorily and is industrially accepted for defect prediction capability. Die cooling is an effective technique to reduce internal porosity in die cast components. But die cooling process is not completely captured in the approach used in the casting simulations. This often resulted in false positives in the defect predictions. One of the main reasons for the lack of precision in simulation is the uncertainty in assigning the boundary conditions such as heat transfer coefficients (HTC) for the die cooling channel. In this study, a coupled simulation strategy was developed to determine accurate HTC values of the die cooling channel. The computational domain was divided into two sub-domains, i.e., casting zone and die cooling zone. Two different industrially accepted simulation tools were used: (a) for casting simulation and (b) for turbulent fluid flow and heat transfer simulation in the cooling channel. A series of iterations were performed by exchanging information at the interface between the two sub-domains till the convergence was achieved. Experiments were also conducted with a thermocouple inserted in the die and the actual die temperature readings were measured. The converged simulation results agreed well with the experimental measurements. Also, the influence of flow rate on HTC was studied by conducting experiments with two different flow rates and the castings produced were analyzed with the help of CT scan analysis, micro-structure evaluation and thermal imaging. The obtained results demonstrated the efficacy of the method adopted in prescribing the values of heat transfer conditions in casting simulations. With the coupled simulation approach developed in this work, parametric studies were conducted to maximize the heat removal rate from a given die, for different flow velocities, nozzle diameters, cooling hole diameters and nozzle-to-surface spacings.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Designing high entropy alloys (HEAs) from a large compositional space is challenging. The design process is accelerated by integrating computational techniques. The current study developed a framework for the accelerated identification of phases in HEAs by integrating high throughput calculations and machine learning (ML). The 19968 composition information was generated using high throughput CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) calculations and used as a dataset for the machine learning algorithms. The Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) makes unbiased data, and multiple machine learning algorithms are trained and compared. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (NN) show test accuracy of ∼99%. The trained algorithm was used to predict phases in ternary, quaternary and quinary systems. The experimental comparison confirms that the algorithms successfully predicted the phase transitions in HEAs with respect to varying compositions. The developed framework can be adopted for designing new materials.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), combined with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), is an extensively used technique for in-depth microstructural analysis. Here, we present the EDS-Phase Segmentation (EDS-PhaSe) tool that enables phase segmentation and phase analysis using the EDS elemental map images. It converts the EDS map images into estimated composition maps for calculating markers of selective elemental redistribution in the scanned area and creates a phase-segmented micrograph while providing approximate fraction and composition of each identified phase. EDS-PhaSe offers two unique advantages. Firstly, it enables the direct processing of EDS elemental map images without requiring any raw or proprietary data/software, thereby allowing the analysis of EDS results available in the published literature as images. Secondly, it enables segmentation and analysis of phases even when the phase contrast is missing in backscattered micrographs, assisting in correlating the XRD and SEM-EDS data as shown in this work for a AlCoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Rapid solidification during metal additive manufacturing (AM) leads to non-equilibrium microsegregation, which can result in the formation of detrimental phases and cracking. Most of the microsegregation models assume a Scheil-type solidification, where the solidification interface is planar and there exists a local equilibrium at the interface along with either zero or infinite solute diffusion in the respective participating phases—solid and liquid. This assumption leads to errors in prediction. One has to account for finite solute diffusion and the curvature at the dendritic tip for more accurate predictions. In this work, we compare different microsegregation models, that do and do not consider finite diffusion and dendrite tip kinetics, against experiments. We also propose a method to couple dendrite tip kinetics with the diffusion module (DICTRA®) implemented in Thermo-Calc®. The models which accounted for both finite diffusion and dendrite tip kinetics matched well with the experimental data.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The multiphase field modelling is a powerful tool to understand sufficiently complicated material transformation phenomena. The numerical implementation of this modelling technique faced many challenges and finally Ohno and Matsuura (2009) provided a consistent model which overcame some of the numerical artifacts of its predecessors. However, the Ohno and Matsuura model has not had a robust numerical implementation. This difficulty in implementation is due to the complicated nature of equations that arise from the model. Furthermore, fitting the model for the desired problem needs a thorough understanding of the behaviour of the model parameters. Hence, this work uses an FEM based solver to understand the use of parameters in a multiphase field model and their effect on interface characteristics. Finally, it is shown how the parameters of the model can be tuned to simulate common types of phase transformation.</td>

The material's hardening and softening characteristics are also explored under various hot working conditions. Deformation twinning is observed in materials deformed at 0.1 s−1 at 1273 K and 1373 K, contributing to their observed hardening. The mean free path of dislocation defines the material's strength, and the transition point from dynamic recovery to dislocation-dislocation or dislocation-solute interaction occurs when the mean free path of dislocation reaches its lowest value. The inhomogeneity in the deformed sample is correlated with the strain field distribution using an integrated approach using finite element method (FEM) modeling and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) results. EBSD characterization reveals the presence of deformation bands and annealing twins at low and high temperatures, respectively. Additionally, an artificial neural network (ANN) model is proposed to predict the hot deformation behavior of Co–Cr–Fe–Ni–V HEA, with promising results, as evidenced by a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.9983 and an average absolute relative error (AARE) of 2.71% on the test dataset.</td>

The as-cast sample has been characterized using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry, which reveals the presence of two phases, disordered γ and ordered γ′. A constitutive relationship between the process parameters (stress temperature, strain, and strain rate) has been drawn using the Arrhenius-type equation to recognize the high temperature deformation behavior of the DP-HEA. The optimum thermomechanical processing window of the DP-HEA has been determined by constructing multiple contour maps based on different parameters such as efficiency, strain rate sensitivity, etc. And the optimum processing domain has been found to lie approximately in the temperature range of 1260–1300 K and SR = 10^–2.3–10^–2 s^−1, 1325–1373 K and SR = 10^–1.4–10^–1 s^−1 &amp; 1173–1193 K and SR = 10^–1.3–10^–1.55 s^−1.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Microstructure and texture evolution of the Fe11.5Co20.6Ni40.7Cr12.2Al7.8Ti7.2 (at. pct) high-entropy alloy during the high-temperature deformation has been investigated in the temperature range of 1173 K to 1373 K and strain rate of 0.1 to 0.001 s−1. The stress–strain curve obtained from the deformation indicates significant flow softening at low temperatures. The softening at 1173 K is due to cracking, whereas high-temperature softening is attributed to dynamic recrystallization (DRX). Arrhenius-type sine hyperbolic relationship is used to carry out the flow stress analysis, and the predicted flow stress shows good agreement with the experimental results with an accuracy of (R2 = 0.955), especially when the deformation takes place at a low strain rate. The estimated strain hardening exponent, n (> 3), and activation energy, Q (> 400 kJ/mol), indicated that the deformation mechanism is dislocation controlled. Detailed microstructural and textural characterization of the hot deformed sample has been carried out using EBSD analysis. Microstructural investigation confirms that dynamic recrystallization is the primary reason behind the flow softening for the samples deformed at 1273 K and above. Strain-free recrystallized grains are found to nucleate near the grain boundary region. Furthermore, the size of the recrystallized grains increases with an increase in temperature and a decrease in strain rate. The volume fraction of the recrystallized grains is found to decrease with an increase in the Zener Holloman parameter. DRX grain was found to possess a weak texture with a low texture index.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Cold spray is the only solid-state coating technique to deposit thick metallic coatings. Deposition of metallic and metallic alloy powders is carried out at the temperature lower than the melting point. Since spraying of Al-based aerospace alloys are associated with nozzle clogging, successful deposition is restricted to nitrogen or helium as the main process gas with a polymer nozzle. Deposition of the alloys using air as process gas at elevated stagnation temperatures (up to 600 °C) has benefits in the repair and refurbishment sector, especially in aerospace. In this study, the effect of elevated stagnation temperatures (from 400 to 600 °C) using air as the main process gas on the deposition characteristics of aerospace grade Al-alloys (Cp-Al, Al-2024, Al-6061 and Al-7075) is studied. Deposition of the alloys at various stagnation temperatures is studied using FEM and correlated with the coating thickness. The deposition behaviour is studied using various parameters such as lattice misfit calculations and solid solution strengthening calculations. The ease of cold spray deposition of Al-aerospace alloys is systematically studied and listed as Al-6061 > Cp-Al > Al-7075 > Al-2024 for the first time.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Laser metal deposited processed Ni-based superalloy IN718 is characterized by elemental micro-segregation, anisotropy, and Laves phases due to the rapid solidification and therefore needs homogenization heat treatment to achieve comparable properties of wrought alloys. In this article, we report a simulation-based methodology to design heat treatment IN718 in a laser metal deposition (LMD) process by using Thermo-calc. Initially, the finite element modeling simulates the laser melt pool to compute the solidification rate (G) and temperature gradient (R). Then, the primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS) is computed through Kurz-Fisher and Trivedi modeling integrated with finite element method (FEM) solver. Later, a DICTRA homogenization model based on the PDAS input values computes the homogenization heat treatment time and temperature. The simulated time scales are verified for two different experiments with contrast laser parameters and are found to be in good agreement confirmed with the results from scanning electron microscopy. Finally, a methodology for integrating the process parameter with the heat treatment design is developed, and a heat treatment map for IN718 is generated that can be integrated with an FEM solver for the first time in the LMD process.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: 2XXX series aluminium alloys are widely used in propellant tanks of space launch vehicles. In this work, friction stir welding (FSW) was performed to produce dissimilar joints between 2195 and 2219 alloys. The effect of temperature (ambient, 77K and 20K) on the tensile properties of 2195–2219 joints was investigated. Results showed that a decrease in temperature increased the tensile properties significantly without a reduction in ductility. Due to contribution from 2195 alloy, the properties of the dissimilar joint were marginally higher than the 2219 similar joint. The failure location in the thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ) of the 2219 side was substantiated with the hardness survey across the weld. The effect of material position at advancing side (AS) and retreating side (RS) on tensile properties of dissimilar joints was investigated. Results depicted that regardless of the material position, the failure was consistently observed at TMAZ of 2219. However, placing 2219 at the AS showed better properties than at RS. This study brought out the tensile behaviour at cryogenic temperatures and suitable material position to achieve optimum strength, which are key inputs for designing launch vehicle structures.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: From thermodynamical consideration, rather a monotonically increasing crystal growth velocity with increasing undercooling is expected in the crystallization of liquids, mixtures, and alloys [P.K. Galenko and D. Jou, Physics Reports 818 (2019) 1]. By contrast to this general theoretical statement, Al-rich Al-Ni alloys show an anomalous solidification behavior: the solid-liquid interface velocity slows down as the undercooling increases [R. Lengsdorf, D. Holland-Moritz, D. M. Herlach, Scripta Materialia 62 (2010) 365]. It is also found that besides the anomalous growth behaviour, changes in the shape of the recalescence front as the growth front morphology occur. In the light of recent measurements in microgravity with an Al-25at.% Ni alloy sample onboard the International Space Station (ISS) results confirming this anomalous behavior as an unexpected trend in solidification kinetics are presented. The measurements show multiple nucleation events forming the growth front, a mechanism that has been observed for the first time in Al-Ni alloys [D. Herlach et al., Physical Review Materials 3 (2019) 073402; M. Reinartz et al. JOM 74 (2022) 2420] and summarized with detailed analysis in the present publication over a wider range of concentrations. Particularly, the experimental measurements and obtained data directly demonstrate that the growth front does thus not consist of dendrite tips (as in usual rapid solidifying samples), but of newly forming nuclei propagating along the sample surface in a coordinated manner. Theoretical analysis on intensive nucleation ahead of crystal growth front is made using the previously developed model [D.V. Alexandrov, Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical 50 (2017) 345101]. Using equations of this model, quantitative calculations confirm the interpretation of experimentally observed propagation of the recalescence front and obtained data on the microstructure of droplets solidified in electromagnetic levitation facility (EML) on the Ground, under reduced gravity during parabolic flights, and in microgravity conditions onboard the ISS.</td>

The complexity of the physical processes have hitherto limited growth models to simple assumptions that do not lead to satisfactory predictive capability. Experimental measurements of growth velocity as a function of undercooling are also tedious. The current study uses experimental and literature data to train the machine learning algorithms. Five algorithms are trained: Random Forest, Bagging Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Network. A labeled data set of 910 was used, with 70% data for training and 30 % data for testing. An R2 cross-validation score of more than 0.89 was obtained for ANN. The trained algorithms are used to predict the growth velocity of medium and high entropy alloys show good compatibility with the experimental data.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Haynes 282 is a creep-resistant, γ′ strengthened nickel-based superalloy with excellent weldability. Additive manufacturing, especially laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), of Haynes 282 is being researched for its potential applications in aerospace and power generation sectors. LPBF enables us to achieve desired properties via microstructure control through process parameter optimization. Integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) approach can be used to tune the process parameters to obtain desired microstructure, instead of trial-and-error methods. In this report, ICME framework has been established to simulate microstructural evolution during LPBF and post-processing of Haynes 282. A dimensionless number was used to optimize the process parameters with minimal porosity. Thermal modelling was performed using a semi-analytical model and the obtained thermal data was used to simulate solidification during LPBF. The corresponding cell spacing obtained matched closely with the experimental data. The segregation pattern extracted from the phase-field model was used as input for homogenization simulation. The γ′ precipitate evolution was predicted using Langer–Schwartz theory and Kampmann–Wagner-Numerical (KWN) approach. The predicted values agreed with the experimentally measured values. The room temperature yield strength of as-built samples was comparable and that of heat-treated samples were superior to the aged wrought material.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Inconel 718 as-welded structures are widely used in many critical applications. Welding will cause different types of detrimental phase formation and segregation of elements in the inter-dendritic region. The segregation of elements depends on the local curvatures during morphological evolution dictated by the thermal conditions prevailing during the process. In this study, we establish the segregation behavior of Inconel 718 as a function of solidification conditions. Microstructure evolution was correlated with Scheil's solidification predictions for different cooling rates and temperature gradients. The solidification pathway of segregated composition depends on the process parameters via the microstructure. Simulation results are validated with the experimental results, and the microstructure comparison shows good agreement. An integrated workflow is proposed to accelerate the welding process optimization and produce desired microstructure for multi-component alloys.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Identification of compositions that form solid solution phases from a large compositional space is challenging. The current study focuses on applying multiple machine learning classification algorithms for suitably predicting new medium to high entropy alloys with solid solution phases. The current data set used for training and testing consisting of 664 labeled data with 267 BCC alloys, 199 FCC alloys, and 198 (FCC + BCC) alloys to avoid biased predicting. The analyzed data shows a strong correlation between the empirical design parameters. The correlation coefficient values changed while moving the alloy system from medium to high entropy domain. The parameters VEC and Tm show high importance in prediction compared to other parameters. The importance of design parameters is analyzed, and the accuracy is quantified. The experimental results validate the prediction of a shift from BCC + FCC to FCC phases while increasing Ni content in the CoCuFeNix system.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The effect of replacement of molybdenum with small amount of tungsten on the stability of cobalt based superalloys of Co–Ni–Mo–Al–Ta–Ti class has been presented. A small addition of tungsten (W) in Co–30Ni–(5-x)Mo–10Al–2Ta–2Ti–2W alloys stabilizes the cuboidal morphology of precipitates and increases the γ′ volume fraction. A 2 at% addition of W causes an increase of 60 °C in solvus temperature of the base superalloy to reach a value of 1130 °C with a slight increase of mass density to 8.79 g/cc. Beside partitioning into γ′, W also shifts the partitioning preference of Mo from the γ′ phase in 0W alloy to that of equal partitioning in both γ and γ’ phases in 2W alloy. An interfacial confinement of Mo atoms could be observed at the γ/γ′ interfaces that reduces interface energy leading to enhanced microstructural stability. The experimentally determined temporal evolution of average precipitate size in the 2W alloy at the temperatures of 800, 900 and 950 °C suggests a matrix diffusion limited coarsening kinetics. The estimated coarsening rate constant at 900 °C follows a quasi-steady state model and is comparable to those observed for W and Re containing Co-based superalloys. The activation energy for γ′ precipitate coarsening is estimated to be 258 ± 6 kJ/mole, which is comparable to the Mo diffusion in the γ-Co matrix suggesting Mo diffusion still controls the precipitate coarsening in the 2W alloy.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: An integrated computational materials engineering (ICME)-based workflow was adopted for the study of microstructure and property evolution at the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of gas metal arc-welded DP980 steel. The macroscale simulation of the welding process was performed with finite element method (FEM) implemented in Simufact Welding® software and was experimentally validated. The time–temperature profile at HAZ obtained from FEM simulation was physically simulated using Gleeble 3800® thermo-mechanical simulator with a dilatometer attachment. The resulting phase transformations and microstructure were studied experimentally. The austenite-to-ferrite and austenite-to-bainite transformations during cooling at HAZ were simulated using the Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov (JMAK) equation implemented in JMatPro® software and with phase-field modeling implemented in Micress® software. The phase fractions and the phase transformation kinetics simulated by phase-field method agreed well with experiments. A single scaling factor introduced in JMatPro® software minimized the deviation between calculations and experiments. Asymptotic homogenization implemented in Homat® software was used to calculate the effective macroscale thermo-elastic properties from the phase-field simulated microstructure. FEM-based virtual uniaxial tensile test with Abaqus® software was used to calculate the effective macroscale flow curves from the phase-field simulated microstructure. The flow curve from virtual test simulation showed good agreement with the flow curve obtained with tensile test in Gleeble®. An ICME-based vertical integration workflow in two stages is proposed. With this ICME workflow, effective properties at the macroscale could be obtained by taking microstructure morphology and orientation into consideration.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Equiatomic RNi (where R = Gd, Ho and Er) compounds have been prepared by undercooling. Magnetization data confirm ferromagnetic ordering of the samples at 69 K, 35 K and 10 K (TC) respectively. Magnetocaloric effect (MCE) has been estimated in terms of isothermal magnetic entropy change (ΔSm) near TC. The maximum ΔSm value (ΔSmmax) for 50 kOe field change is about −18 Jkg-1K−1, −20 Jkg-1K−1 and −30 Jkg-1K−1 respectively near TC for the undercooled RNi (R = Gd, Ho and Er) compounds. The ΔSmmax value is more than that obtained for the same compounds prepared by arc-melting and melt-spinning techniques. The observed enhancement in MCE of the undercooled samples could be due to the improved purity that results in faster change of magnetization around the magnetic transition. Thus undercooling rare earth intermetallics and alloys seems to be an attractive, alternative method to synthesize magnetocaloric materials.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Studies on solidification of equiatomic multi-component alloys are essential in developing melt-route processing of high entropy alloys. The extent of undercooling during processing controls microstructure evolution. In this study, we present solidification studies on undercooled equiatomic FeCuNi alloy carried out using melt fluxing technique. The alloy shows a two-phase (FCC + FCC) microstructure even at deep undercooling of more than 200 K. The dendrite growth velocity measured using high-speed video imaging shows a nonlinear increase in growth velocity with the increase in the extent of undercooling. A modified dendritic growth model was able to predict the growth velocity. The segregation behaviour and microstructures at different extents of undercooling can be predicted using phase field simulation.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The case hardening process (carburizing followed by quenching to room temperature) is one of the heat treatments routinely conducted in various industrial sectors. Depending on the parameters applied during the post-carburizing stage, different microstructural constituents may develop in the interior (core) section of a case-hardened component which substantially influence the overall mechanical properties. In the present work, the effects of different heat treatments following the carburizing stage on the core microstructure evolution, the resulting toughness and hardness properties were investigated. The heat treatments were carried out employing Navy C-ring specimens, the core of which were used for microstructural investigations and fabrication of mini-Charpy specimens. Besides, nanoindentation tests were also carried out in the same region to examine the local hardness of different constituents. Furthermore, the microstructural evolutions were also studied utilizing multi-phase field modeling. Based on the obtained results, it can be shown that the increase in fractions of bainite and retained austenite is in direct correlation with the impact toughness improvement, however, the increase in fraction of ferrite and martensite acts inversely. Moreover, despite the differences in fractions of constituents, the level of overall hardness is similar in all the developed microstructures. Additionally, the nanoindentation results revealed that the formation of large fraction of bainitic ferrite leads to high level of scattering in nanohardness of martensite. Phase field simulations show that this is attributed to the degree of carbon partitioning into the adjacent austenitic area where depending on the local morphology and size can be quite different.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In recent years, several multicomponent alloys of near equiatomic composition (also known as high-entropy alloys) with excellent mechanical properties have been developed. In this study, a eutectic high entropy alloy, CoCrFeNiNb0.45, was chosen for a hot deformation study. The alloy consists of a primary face-centered cubic (FCC) phase (CoCrFeNi rich) and a eutectic region between the FCC and Laves phase (Co2Nb type). The combination of FCC and eutectic region is expected to provide better strength and ductility. Hot compression tests were carried out at different strain rates of 0.001, 0.1, 1, and 10 s−1 with varying temperatures of 1,073, 1,173, 1,273, and 1,323 K. The optimum processing window was identified by plotting processing maps, and the instability region was verified using multiple parameters. Constitutive equation relating stress, strain rate, and temperature is established. The optimum processing condition was correlated with the microstructural characterization, and instability was characterized with cracks on the specimen. Finite element simulation was carried out, taking the flow curve as input and correlating the strain field distribution with the microhardness variation. These studies are intended to contribute to an integrated computational materials engineering approach to developing these alloys toward a product.</td>

The desirable phase α−Nb5Si3 phase could be obtained in alloys containing 4 at. % or more Zr. Nanoindentation results showed that the elastic modulus of Nbss phase is not significantly influenced by Zr additions whereas elastic modulus of Nb3Si and α−Nb5Si3phases are considerably improved by Zr additions.

These parameters affected heat input generation in the welds, thereby influencing stir zone geometry, grain size evolution in stir zone, tensile properties and hardness of the weld. Low tool rotation speed and high travel speed resulted in finer grain size. Travel speed significantly affected the tensile properties compared to rotation speed.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In the design of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) with desired properties, identifying the effects of elements plays an important role. HEAs with eutectic microstructure can be obtained by judiciously modifying the alloy compositions. In this study, the effect of Nb addition to FeCoNiCuNbx (x = 0.5, 5, 7.5, 11.6, 15) alloys was studied by varying the Nb concentration (at.%). FeCoNiCuNb0.5 HEA shows liquid phase separation to form Cu-rich and FeCoNiCu-rich phases. Detailed solidification paths are proposed for these alloys, which show eutectic, peritectic, and pseudo quasi-peritectic reactions. Increasing Nb content promotes the liquid phase separation tendency and causes the formation of Cu-rich spheres. The effect of Nb on the FeCoNiCu-rich phase was studied based on the nanoindentation and correlated with nanohardness. The compressive deformation properties of these alloys are studied at room temperature and high temperature and correlated with microstructure. Fractography results show the mode of fracture and are correlated with the microstructure obtained.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In the present work, the role of Zr addition on the microstructure and phase formation of hypoeutectic Nb−16 at. % Si alloy has been investigated. The results showed that both binary and alloy with 2 at. % Zr resulted in two phase microstructures composed of Nbss and Nb3Si phases. In contrast, the alloys with 4 at. % Zr and 6 at. % Zr revealed two phase microstructures composed of Nbss and α−Nb5Si3 phases. The orientation relationship (OR) obtained between eutectoid lamellar structure comprising of Nbss and α−Nb5Si3 phases is (110) Nb//(110) Nb5Si3. The equilibrium microstructures consisting of Nb and α−Nb5Si3 phases were obtained in as cast condition when the Zr concentration is above 2 at.%. The addition of Zr accelerated the dissociation kinetics of Nb3Si phase in to Nbss and α−Nb5Si3 phases during solidification. The formation of α−Nb5Si3 phase in the as cast condition eliminates heat treatment required for decomposition of Nb3Si phase in Nb-Si alloys.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Recently, cobalt-based γ-γ′ microstructured superalloys have attracted attention. However, studies on their processing behavior [i.e., processing maps (the variation of strain rate sensitivity (m) with temperature)] are limited. Thus, the high-temperature flow behavior of a γ-γ′ Co-30Ni-10Al-5Mo-2Ta-2Ti-5Cr (at. pct) superalloy was investigated using isothermal compression tests between 1348 and 1498 K at strain rates from 0.001 to 10 s−1. The m contour map was generated using the experimental flow stress values, which were used to locate the optimum hot workability and desired microstructural processing range. A strong dependence of m on the deformation parameters (temperature, strain rate, and strain) was observed. A maximum m value of around 0.3 at 1460 K to 1498 K and strain rates of 0.01 to 0.5 s−1 was found. The deformed samples show a fully recrystallized microstructure at high m. Unstable domains showed the formation of cavities at the grain boundary triple points and cracks along the grain boundaries at high strain rates (1 to 10 s−1), corresponding to m < 0.10. A constitutive model was developed using an Arrhenius hyperbolic sine function, yielding an apparent activation energy of 540 ± 30 kJ mol−1 for hot deformation. This study indicates reasonable formability under certain conditions below the solvus, thus opening possibilities for further thermomechanical treatment.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Dual phase steel is one of the future materials for automobile industry, as it shows a combination of high strength and adequate formability. Studies have shown that it has the potential to occupy up to 80% of the total weight of a car. Residual stress during heat treatments is one of the issues that need to be studied in dual phase steel and computational simulations can help in reducing the experimental trials required for such a study. The heat transfer simulation in such a material is challenging, as it involves phase transformation at the microscale. In the present work, an attempt is made to incorporate the effect of phase transformation at the microscale while simulating the macroscale heat transfer and consequent residual stress. A novel and simple flat geometry is chosen for study that helps in easy measurement of residual stresses. The geometry is a rectangular strip with an elliptical hole and the role played by the angle of elliptical hole on residual stress prediction is discussed. Finite Element simulation of the heat transfer and the subsequent residual stress is performed using the commercial software Simufact Forming®. The effect of microscale phase transformations on the residual stress was considered during the software simulations. These simulations are validated using physical simulations in Gleeble® and measurement of macroscale residual stress with X-Ray diffraction technique.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The present investigation reports phase and microstructure evolution during solidification of novel Ni-rich Ni-Ti-based alloys, Ni60Ti40, Ni50Cu10Ti40, Ni48Cu10Co2Ti40, and Ni48Cu10Co2Ti38Ta2 during suction casting. The design philosophy of the multicomponent alloys involves judicious selection of alloying elements such as Cu, Co, and Ta in the near Ni60Ti40 eutectic alloy by replacing both Ni and Ti so that phase mixture in the microstructure remains the same from the binary to quinary alloy. The basic objective is to study the effect of addition of Cu, Co, and Ta on the phase evolution and transformation in the Ni-rich Ni-Ti-based alloys. The detailed electron microscopic studies on these suction cast alloys reveal the presence of ultrafine eutectic lamellae between NiTi and Ni3Ti phases along with dendritic NiTi and Ti2Ni phases. It has also been observed that in the binary (Ni60Ti40) alloy, the ordered NiTi (B2) phase transforms to trigonal (R) phase followed by NiTi martensitic phase (M-phase), i.e., B2 → R-phase → M-phase during solid-state cooling. However, the addition of alloying elements such as Cu, Co to the binary (Ni60Ti40) alloy suppresses the martensitic transformation of the ordered NiTi (B2) dendrite. Thus, in the ternary and quaternary alloys, the ordered NiTi (B2) phase is transformed to only trigonal (R) phase, i.e., B2 → R-phase. The secondary precipitate of Ti2Ni has been observed in all of the studied alloys. Interestingly, Ni48Cu10Co2Ti38Ta2 quinary alloy shows the disordered nature of NiTi dendrites. The experimentally observed solidification path is in good agreement with Gulliver–Scheil simulated path for binary alloy, whereas simulated solidification path deviates from the experimental results in case of ternary, quaternary, and quinary alloys.</td>

It is found that FEA without phase transformation<br>	effects overestimates the residual stresses in the fusion zone (FZ)<br>	and heat affected zone (HAZ). It is also found that a trailing heat<br>	sink reduces transverse compressive residual stresses thus minimizing<br>	the possibilities of buckling.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Weld distortion and residual stresses are two major issues in the<br>	fabrication process. Numerical techniques are being tried out to<br>	accurately predict the structural integrity of the welding. Interpass<br>	time in the multipass welding is an important parameter which influences<br>	the weld distortion and residual stresses. In this study two pass<br>	tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding of 6 mm mild steel plates has been<br>	analyzed using Finite element analysis (FEA) software Sysweld and<br>	parametric study is conducted with different interpass time. The<br>	temperature distribution, distortion and residual stresses are calculated<br>	using three dimensional finite element model (FEM) considering phase<br>	transformations in the material. The transient thermo-metallurgical<br>	analysis followed by elasto-plastic analysis is carried out using<br>	temperature dependent and phase dependent material properties. The<br>	material deposition in the multipass welding is numerically simulated<br>	using chewing gum method, where dummy phase and dummy material are<br>	assigned for the element activation. The phase proportions are calculated<br>	by assigning suitable phase kinetics parameter extracted from continuous<br>	cooling transformation (CCT) diagram of a given material. Experiments<br>	are conducted for validation after given edge preparation and using<br>	same material as filler wire. The FEM analysis is carried out for<br>	eight cases with different time interval between passes, starting<br>	from 30 s to 240 s in the steps of 30 s. FEM results are verified<br>	with experimentally measured values. It is found that the time interval<br>	between passes has less influence on the residual stresses but significantly<br>	affects the distortion and phase proportion due to the first pass<br>	preheating effect on second pass and second pass postheating effect<br>	on first pass.

Detailed microstructural studies and microhardness tests<br>	were carried out on the coatings. Studies revealed defect-free coatings<br>	and sound metallurgical bonding between the coating and the substrate.<br>	In addition, mechanical interlocking on a very fine scale was observed<br>	to occur between the coating and the substrate. Coatings exhibited<br>	martensitic microstructure with fine grain size and with no carbide<br>	particles. Coatings in as-deposited condition showed very high hardness<br>	(58 HRC) compared to the mechtrode material in annealed condition<br>	(20 HRC). Based on these findings, microstructural evolution during<br>	friction surfacing of H13 tool steel is discussed.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Although the grain-refinement practice is well established for wrought<br>	Al alloys, in the case of foundry alloys such as near eutectic Al-Si<br>	alloys, the underlying mechanisms and the use of grain refiners need<br>	better understanding. Conventional grain refiners such as Al-5Ti-1B<br>	are not effective in grain refining the Al-Si alloys due to the poisoning<br>	effect of Si. In this work, we report the results of a newly developed<br>	grain refiner, which can effectively grain refine as well as modify<br>	eutectic and primary Si in near eutectic Al-Si alloys. Among the<br>	material choices, the grain refining response with Al-1Ti-3B master<br>	alloy is found to be superior compared to the conventional Al-5Ti-1B<br>	master alloy. It was also found that magnesium additions of 0.2 wt<br>	pct along with the Al-1Ti-3B master alloy further enhance the near<br>	eutectic Al-Si alloy's grain refining efficiency, thus leading to<br>	improved bulk mechanical properties. We have found that magnesium<br>	essentially scavenges the oxygen present on the surface of nucleant<br>	particles, improves wettability, and reduces the agglomeration tendency<br>	of boride particles, thereby enhancing grain refining efficiency.<br>	It allows the nucleant particles to act as potent and active nucleation<br>	sites even at levels as low as 0.2 pct in the Al-1Ti-3B master alloy.<br>	© 2011 The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society and ASM International.</td>

The change in shape and stability<br>	of the melt puddle as a function of the processing parameter was<br>	studied using a high-speed imaging system and was correlated to ribbon<br>	formation. A window of process parameters for obtaining continuous<br>	ribbons with good surface quality has been evaluated.

The higher melt temperature leads to the formation<br>	of crystalline phase in as-spun ribbons, and this deteriorates the<br>	soft magnetic properties on annealing.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Thixocasting requires manufacturing of billets with non-dendritic<br>	microstructure. Aluminum alloy A356 billets were produced by rheocasting<br>	in a mould placed inside a linear electromagnetic stirrer. Subsequent<br>	heat treatment was used to produce a transition from rosette to globular<br>	microstructure. The current and the duration of stirring were explored<br>	as control parameters. Simultaneous induction heating of the billet<br>	during stirring was quantified using experimentally determined thermal<br>	profiles. The effect of processing parameters on the dendrite fragmentation<br>	was discussed. Corresponding computational modeling of the process<br>	was performed using phase-field modeling of alloy solidification<br>	in order to gain insight into the process of morphological changes<br>	of a solid during this process. A non-isothermal alloy solidification<br>	model was used for simulations. The morphological evolution under<br>	such imposed thermal cycles was simulated and compared with experimentally<br>	determined one. Suitable scaling using the thermosolutal diffusion<br>	distances was used to overcome computational difficulties in quantitative<br>	comparison at system scale. The results were interpreted in the light<br>	of existing theories of microstructure refinement and globularisation.<br>	© 2010 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The solidification of concentrated alloys containing ordered compounds<br>	is less well understood.

Solidification<br>	of the undercooled melt was detected at undercooling levels within<br>	the range of 30 K<ΔT<300 K. The new data reveal high accuracy and<br>	low scattering. These data are compared with two independent growth<br>	velocity data sets and discrepancies are discussed. For verification<br>	of the new CPS data dendrite growth velocity was also measured by<br>	using a high-speed camera where the morphology of the intersection<br>	of the solidification front with the sample surface was investigated.<br>	The new experimental data are analyzed within the model of dendrite<br>	growth obtained on the basis of Brener's theory [E.

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In order to obtain basic understanding of microstructure evolution<br>	in laser-surface-alloyed layers, aluminum was surface alloyed on<br>	a pure nickel substrate using a CO2 laser. By varying the laser scanning<br>	speed, the composition of the surface layers can be systematically<br>	varied. The Ni content in the layer increases with increase in scanning<br>	speed. Detailed cross-sectional transmission electron microscopic<br>	study reveals complexities in solidification behavior with increased<br>	nickel content. It is shown that ordered B2 phase forms over a wide<br>	range of composition with subsequent precipitation of Ni2Al, an ordered<br>	ω phase in the B2 matrix, during solid-state cooling. For nickel-rich<br>	alloys associated with higher laser scan speed, the fcc γ phase is<br>	invariably the first phase to grow from the liquid with solute trapping.<br>	The phase reorders in the solid state to yield γ′ Ni3Al. The phase<br>	competes with β AlNi, which forms massively from the liquid. The<br>	β AlNi transforms martensitically to a 3R structure during cooling<br>	in solid state. The results can be rationalized in terms of a metastable<br>	phase diagram proposed earlier. However, the results are at variance<br>	with earlier studies of laser processing of nickel-rich alloys.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, a three-dimensional transient macroscopic numerical<br>	model is developed for the description of transport phenomena during<br>	laser surface alloying. In order to make accurate estimates for the<br>	species composition distribution during the process, the addition<br>	of alloying elements is formulated by devising a species generation<br>	term for the solute transport equation. By employing a particle-tracking<br>	algorithm and a simultaneous particle-melting consideration, the<br>	species source term is estimated by the amount of fusion of a spherical<br>	particle as it passes through a particular control volume. Numerical<br>	simulations are performed for two cases. The first case corresponds<br>	to aluminium as alloying element on a nickel substrate, while the<br>	second case is for alloying nickel on aluminium substrate. It is<br>	observed for the latter case that the melting of the alloying element<br>	is not instantaneous, and hence it cannot be modelled as a species<br>	mass flux boundary condition at the top surface. The predicted results<br>	are compared with experiments, and the agreement is found to be good.<br>	© 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: Composite coatings containing quasicrystalline (QC) phases in Al-Cu-Fe<br>	alloys were prepared by laser cladding using a mixture of the elemental<br>	powders. Two substrates, namely pure aluminum and an Al-Si alloy<br>	were used. The clad layers were remelted at different scanning velocities<br>	to alter the growth conditions of different phases. The process parameters<br>	were optimized to produce quasicrystalline phases. The evolution<br>	of the microstructure in the coating layer was characterized by detailed<br>	microstructural investigation. The results indicate presence of quasicrystals<br>	in the aluminum substrate. However, only approximant phase could<br>	be observed in the substrate of Al-Si alloys. It is shown that there<br>	is a significant transport of Si atoms from the substrate to the<br>	clad layer during the cladding and remelting process. The hardness<br>	profiles of coatings on aluminum substrate indicate a very high hardness.<br>	The coating on Al-Si alloy, on the other hand, is ductile and soft.<br>	The fracture toughness of the hard coating on aluminum was obtained<br>	by nano-indentation technique. The K1C value was found to be 1.33<br>	MPa m1/2 which is typical of brittle materials.</td>

	<td><b>Abstract</b>: The transport phenomena (heat transfer, fluid flow and species distribution)<br>	are numerically modelled for the case of laser welding of dissimilar<br>	metals. The model involves convection in the weld pool along with<br>	melting and mixing. The associated metallurgical phenomenon is an<br>	extremely complex one, and the present work is a preliminary attempt<br>	to model the process after making suitable assumptions. The numerical<br>	study is performed using a pressure based finite volume technique<br>	after making appropriate modifications to the algorithm to include<br>	the associated phase change processes and dissimilarity in the metal<br>	properties. The phase change process is modelled using an enthalpy-porosity<br>	technique, while the dissimilar metal properties are handled using<br>	appropriate mixture theories. As a case study, we have used dissimilar<br>	couples of copper-nickel. It is observed that the weld pool shape<br>	becomes asymmetric even when the heat source is symmetrically applied<br>	on the two metals forming the couple. As the weld pool develops,<br>	the side melting earlier is found to experience more convection and<br>	better mixing. Corresponding experiments are performed using the<br>	same parameters as in the computations, showing a good qualitative<br>	agreement between the two results. A scale analysis is performed<br>	to predict the time scale of initiation of melting of each metal.<br>	The scale-analysis predictions show a good agreement with the numerical<br>	results.</td>
